          Using classes allows styling multiple elements with the same design, while IDs are unique to each page. -->
    <h2>Life Cycle</h2>
    <p>
     Frogs begin life as eggs in water, hatch into tadpoles, and grow legs as they
     transform into adult frogs. This is called metamorphosis.

    <p>
      Many frogs are nocturnal. They use sticky tongues to catch insects and call loudly to attract mates.
