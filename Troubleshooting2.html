  <!-- Linked external stylesheet 'tstyle2.css' for page styling.
       This link connects the HTML to an external CSS file that defines
       how the elements on the page should look — including colors, layout, and fonts.
       Keeping styles in a separate file improves organization and makes maintenance easier. -->

      <!-- Closed <h1> tag properly to ensure valid HTML structure.
           The <h1> tag defines the main heading of the page, which is important for both accessibility and SEO.
           Leaving it unclosed could break the document structure and cause rendering issues in browsers. -->
      <h1>🐸 Frogs of the Rainforest</h1>

      <!-- Closed <h2> tag properly for semantic correctness.
           The <h2> heading helps organize content hierarchically under the main title.
           Proper heading structure improves screen reader navigation and search engine readability. -->
      <h2>Name</h2>

<div class="panel">
     <!-- Properly closed <h2> tag to maintain document hierarchy.
          Consistent heading levels create logical content flow and make the webpage easier to navigate.
          This also ensures that assistive technologies can correctly interpret the content structure. -->
     <h2>Meet the Frogs</h2>
     <p>
     Frogs are incredible amphibians that live on every continent except Antarctica.
     Their smooth, moist skin helps them breathe through it.
     </p>
</div>

     <!-- Corrected invalid attribute 'floss' to 'class' to conform to HTML standards.
          Using the correct 'class' attribute allows CSS to target and style this section effectively.
          Invalid attributes are ignored by browsers and can break the intended layout or design. -->
<div class="panel">
     <h2>Life Cycle</h2>
     <p>
     Frogs begin life as eggs in water, hatch into tadpoles, and grow legs as they
     transform into adult frogs. This is called metamorphosis.
     </p>
  
<div id="pond">
     <p>Here’s a “pond” — the parent container.</p>

<div id="tadpole">
        <!-- Corrected closing tag from </strange> to </strong> to fix invalid HTML.
             The <strong> tag is used to emphasize important words or phrases, typically displaying them in bold.
             Incorrect closing tags can break the page structure or cause unexpected text formatting issues. -->
      <p>I'm positioned <strong>absolutely</strong> within my parent!</p>
      </div>
      </div>
      </div> <!-- Added missing closing </div> to properly close the 'Life Cycle' section.
                  Without this tag, the structure of nested elements would be broken,
                  which could lead to layout errors or unexpected behavior in styling. -->
<div class="panel">
      <!-- Replaced incorrect closing tag </h3> with </h2> to match the opening tag.
           Matching tags ensure that HTML remains valid and predictable.
           Using inconsistent heading levels or incorrect closures can confuse both browsers and users. -->
      <h2>Behavior</h2>
      <p>
      Many frogs are nocturnal. They use sticky tongues to catch insects and call loudly to attract mates.
      </p>

<div id="fun-fact">
     <!-- Added missing closing tags for <strong> and <p> to maintain valid markup.
          Every opened tag in HTML should be properly closed to keep the structure clean.
          Missing tags can cause display errors, broken layouts, or issues with accessibility tools. -->
     <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Some frogs can leap more than 20 times their body length!</p>
